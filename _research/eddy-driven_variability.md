### What is eddy-driven or intrinsic oceanic variability ?
Because the ocean is far from being calm and laminar, flow instabilities generate mesoscale eddies that interact with themselves and with the mean circulation, eventually yielding a complex turbulent behaviour. Not only these oceanic eddies tend to impact larger scales, they also affect longer timescales and may spontaneously generate a so-called intrinsic variability up to decadal timescales. Thus, even in the absence of a time varying external forcing, eddy-driven variability is self-generated by oceanic nonlinear processes, hence the term intrinsic.
