	title = {Intrinsic variability in the global eddying ocean: an {OGCM}-based analysis of spatiotemporal scales},
	abstract = {Ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) spontaneously generate low-frequency intrinsic variability when their
resolution allows the production of mesoscale eddies (e.g. 1/4◦ and finer). Global variance analysis (Penduff et
al., 2011) and regional EOF analysis (Taguchi et al., 2010) on Sea Surface Height have shown that this intrinsic
contribution to the total variability is particularly strong in eddy-active regions, and may largely dominate the
atmospherically-forced component.
In this presentation, we investigate the spatiotemporal scales of this oceanic intrinsic variability from a
327-year seasonally-forced global 1/4◦ OGCM simulation (no interannual forcing), and its 50-year counterpart
driven by the full range of atmospheric timescales (with interannual forcing). Both model outputs are low-passed
filtered temporally to extract interannual-to-decadal scales. We then compare the spatial scales and magni-
tudes of the full and intrinsic low-frequency variabilities. Results are presented for variables (e.g. Sea-Surface
Temperature, Mixed Layer Depth, Heat fluxes) that are significantly impacted by intrinsic variability, and that
are likely to be involved in the processes which couple the ocean, the atmosphere, and the biogeochemical systems.
We argue that such OGCM-based investigations extend and fruitfully complement more idealized dynami-
cal system studies, which have shown the intrinsic and chaotic nature of transitions between circulation patterns
(e.g. Pierini and Dijkstra, 2009).},

	abstract = {The low-frequency variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is investigated from 2°, 1/4°, and 1/12° global ocean/seaice simulations, with a specific focus on its internally-generated (i.e. ”intrinsic”) component. A 327-year climatological 1/4° simulation, driven by a repeated seasonal cycle (i.e. a forcing devoid of interannual timescales), is shown to spontaneously generate a significant fraction R of the interannual-to-decadal AMOC variance obtained in a 50-year ”fully-forced” hindcast (with reanalyzed atmospheric forcing including interannual timescales). This intrinsic variance fraction R slightly depends on whether AMOCs are computed in geopotential or density coordinates, and on the period considered in the climatological simulation, but the following features are quite robust when mesoscale eddies are simulated (at both 1/4° and 1/12° resolutions): R barely exceeds 5-10\% in the subpolar gyre, but reaches 30-50\% at 34° S, up to 20-40\% near 25°N and 40-60\% near the Gulf Stream. About 25\% of the meridional heat transport interannual variability is attributed to intrinsic processes at 34°S and near the Gulf Stream. Fourier and wavelet spectra, built from the 327-year 1/4° climatological simulation, further indicate that spectral peaks of intrinsic AMOC variability [i] are found at specific frequencies ranging from interannual to multidecadal, [ii] often extend over the whole meridional scale of gyres, [iii] stochastically change throughout these 327 years, and [iv] sometimes match the spectral peaks found in the fully-forced hindcast in the North Atlantic. Intrinsic AMOC variability is also detected at multidecadal timescales, with a marked meridional coherence between 35°S and 25°N (15-30 year periods), and throughout the whole basin (50-90-year periods).},

The authors investigate the temporal and spatial scales at which this intrinsic oceanic variability has the strongest imprints on sea level anomalies (SLAs) using a ° global OGCM, by comparing a “hindcast” driven by the full range of atmospheric time scales with its counterpart forced by a repeated climatological atmospheric seasonal cycle. Outputs from both simulations are compared within distinct frequency–wavenumber bins. The fully forced hindcast is shown to reproduce the observed distribution and magnitude of low-frequency SLA variability very accurately. The small-scale (L {\textless} 6°) SLA variance is, at all time scales, barely sensitive to atmospheric variability and is almost entirely of intrinsic origin. The high-frequency (mesoscale) part and the low-frequency part of this small-scale variability have almost identical geographical distributions, supporting the hypothesis of a nonlinear temporal inverse cascade spontaneously transferring kinetic energy from high to low frequencies. The large-scale (L {\textgreater} 12°) low-frequency variability is mostly related to the atmospheric variability over most of the global ocean, but it is shown to remain largely intrinsic in three eddy-active regions: the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, and Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Compared to its ¼° predecessor, the authors’ ° OGCM is shown to yield a stronger intrinsic SLA variability, at both mesoscale and low frequencies.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the potential of oceanic mesoscale eddies to drive intrinsic low-frequency variability, this paper examines geostrophic turbulence in the frequency–wavenumber domain. Frequency–wavenumber spectra, spectral fluxes, and spectral transfers are computed from an idealized two-layer quasigeostrophic (QG) turbulence model, a realistic high-resolution global ocean general circulation model, and gridded satellite altimeter products. In the idealized QG model, energy in low wavenumbers, arising from nonlinear interactions via the well-known inverse cascade, is associated with energy in low frequencies and vice versa, although not in a simple way. The range of frequencies that are highly energized and engaged in nonlinear transfer is much greater than the range of highly energized and engaged wavenumbers. Low-frequency, low-wavenumber energy is maintained primarily by nonlinearities in the QG model, with forcing and friction playing important but secondary roles. In the high-resolution ocean model, nonlinearities also generally drive kinetic energy to low frequencies as well as to low wavenumbers. Implications for the maintenance of low-frequency oceanic variability are discussed. The cascade of surface kinetic energy to low frequencies that predominates in idealized and realistic models is seen in some regions of the gridded altimeter product, but not in others. Exercises conducted with the general circulation model suggest that the spatial and temporal filtering inherent in the construction of gridded satellite altimeter maps may contribute to the discrepancies between the direction of the frequency cascade in models versus gridded altimeter maps seen in some regions. Of course, another potential reason for the discrepancy is missing physics in the models utilized here.},

	abstract = {Altimetric observations are often interpreted by comparing them with Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) simulations in the turbulent regime, or with Coupled General Circulation Model (CGCM) simulations in which the ocean is generally laminar. Recent OGCM studies have highlighted that when the mesoscale is resolved, the ocean spontaneously generates erratic fluctuations causing strong low-frequency intrinsic sea-level variability over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales (Penduff et al. 2011, Sérazin et al. 2015) ; this nonlinear phenomenon is almost absent in the laminar regime, hence in most CGCM simulations. Using two eddying (1/4° and 1/12°) global OGCMs, we describe the imprint of this low-frequency intrinsic variability on three features of the oceanic circulation obversed by altimetry: interannual sea-level variance, regional sea-level trends, and Western Boundary Currents (WBCs) variability modes.

The interannual (i.e. from 1.5 to 20 years) small-scale ({\textless} 6°) intrinsic sea-level variance that spontaneously emerges under purely seasonal forcing is very comparable to that obtained in fully-forced hindcasts (i.e. with interannual forcing). These scales, which are the main contributor to low-frequency intrinsic variability, may be isolated in the 22-year record of altimetric data using a spatio-temporal filtering as done in Fig. 1. This low-frequency intrinsic variability also has a substantial imprint at larger scales ({\textgreater} 12°) and on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Gregorio et al., 2015).

The ocean spontaneously generates erratic sea-level fluctuations in eddy-active regions up to decadal-to-multidecadal timescales. This ocean-only variability has an imprint on observed regional sea-level trends, especially in the ACC and in the WBC areas. The truncation of this very low-frequency intrinsic variability in the current 22-year altimeter dataset yields an uncertainty in observed sea-level trends ; this eddy-induced uncertainty is actually comparable (and should be added) to that estimated from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) simulations with laminar ocean models.

Finally, the spatial structure of the observed sea-level variability modes in WBCs, which is well simulated by our model with or without low-frequency forcing, is shown to be shaped by oceanic intrinsic processes. The temporal evolution of these spatial modes may be triggered by the low-frequency atmospheric forcing when present, leading to a longer memory than in the purely seasonally-forced case.},

This low-frequency intrinsic variability may be seen in the 22 year record of altimetric data and we propose a method to isolate some intrinsic features in this dataset based on a high-pass spatial filtering.

This study also focus on timescales longer than 20 years using a 300 year long 1/4° simulation, which shows that the ocean spontaneously generates decadal sea-level fluctuations in eddy-active regions. It is shown that this ocean-only variability may have an imprint on observed regional sea-level trend, especially in the ACC and in the Western Boundary Current areas.

eddy-resolving process-oriented models with double-gyre configurations

without low-frequency external forcing (e.g. Berloff et al., 2007, Djikstra

Based on a pair of atmospherically-forced 1/12° OGCM experiments that simulate
with accuracy either the intrinsic variability (seasonally-forced) or the
observed total variability (forced with the full range of atmospheric timescales),
Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis is performed on zonally-averaged SLA

and East Australian Current). The first two modes of the KE and GS
exhibit a similar spatial structure that is shaped by oceanic intrinsic processes.
The frequency content is however different between the intrinsic and total Principal
Components, the former containing a wide range of timescales similar to
a red noise and the latter being more autocorrelated at interannual-to-decadal
timescales. These modes are compared with those obtained from the 20 years of
altimetry observation and relationships with low-frequency westward propagative
features in the respective oceanic basin are investigated.
We argue that OGCM studies of intrinsic dynamic of WBCs are key to interpreting
their observed total variability, which might result from a subtle mixing
between a non-linear small-scale response of intrinsic modes to the atmospheric

This so-called inverse temporal energy cascade is shown to occur in a realistic 1/10° Ocean Global Circulation Model and is known to be a potential candidate to drive low-frequency ({\textgreater} 1yr) oceanic intrinsic variability. Another OGCM study shows that the large small-scale intrinsic SLA variance persists at low-frequency and is localized in similar regions as those with intense mesoscale activity (Sérazin et al. 2014).

This study focus on a 1/12° OGCM sensitivity experiment that is forced only by the seasonal cycle and isolate the variability that spontaneously emerge from oceanic non-linearities. Using the same framework as Arbic et al. (2014), the influence of low meridional wavenumbers is investigated on the intensity of the temporal fluxes by varying the meridional size of the regions of study. The influence of the temporal resolution (daily, 5-daily and monthly means) is also analyzed. Finally, the existence of an arrest scale of the temporal inverse cascade is investigated through a 70-year 5-daily SLA field, which is a decade longer than dataset used in similar studies. 

This study argue that the kinetic energy transfer by the advection term, though it contributes to generate intrinsic variability, might not be the only mecanism occuring in the ocean that produces such variability.},

The frequency content is however different between the intrinsic and total Principal Components, the former containing a wide range of timescales similar to a red noise and the latter being more autocorrelated at interannual-to-decadal timescales. These modes are compared with those obtained from the 20 years of altimetry observation and theoretical mecanisms are discussed.},

(WBC) regions where SST front variations influence basin-scale climate
variability. Observed low-frequency fluctuations in latitude and strengh of these
oceanic jets are classically thought to be essentially atmospherically-driven by
wind stress curl variability via the oceanic Rossby wave adjustment. Yet academic
eddy-resolving process-oriented models with double-gyre configurations
have revealed that an idealized WBC may exhibit low-frequency intrinsic fluctuations
without low-frequency external forcing (e.g. Berloff et al., 2007, Djikstra
and Ghil, 2005, etc). Experiments with eddying Ocean General Circulation
Models (OGCMs) have also shown that the amount of low-frequency Sea Level
Anomaly (SLA) variability is largely intrinsic in WBCs (Penduff et al. 2011)
and that the frontal-scale ({\textless} 10°) pattern of the Kuroshio Extension (KE) variability
is similar to intrinsic modes (Taguchi et al. 2010).

features in the respective oceanic basin are investigated.
We argue that OGCM studies of intrinsic dynamic of WBCs are key to interpreting
their observed total variability, which might result from a subtle mixing
between a non-linear small-scale response of intrinsic modes to the atmospheric
forcing and a direct basin-scale linear response to the atmosphere.},

	title = {Low-frequency intrinsic variability of {Sea} {Surface} {Height} in the global turbulent ocean: spatio-temporal scales},
	abstract = {Recent high-resolution (e.g. 1/4° and finer) Ocean General Circulation Models
(OGCMs) simulate the observed low-frequency sea surface variability with appreciable
skill. In addition, mesoscale eddies are resolved and no longer parametrized
in such highly non-linear models : a substantial amount of the simulated lowfrequency
variability appears spontaneously (i.e. without direct forcing by atmospheric
variability) and imprints several observed quantities (SSH, SST, QNET,
MOC, etc). Penduff et al. (2011) showed that this intrinsic part may account
for most of the low-frequency SSH variance in eddy-active regions. Several idealized
studies have been conducted with academic process-oriented models (e.g.
Berloff et al., 2007, Djikstra and Ghil, 2005, etc), but the structure, scales, and
origin of low-frequency intrinsic variability remain poorly-known in the global
eddying ocean.

A 327-year seasonally-forced global ocean simulation (no interannual forcing)
is compared to its 50-year counterpart driven by the full range of atmospheric
timescales (with interannual forcing). Outputs are band-passed filtered in time
and space. Our results suggest that the low-frequency SSH variability at small
scales ({\textless} 6°) is largely intrinsic and colocated with mesoscale (short time and
space scales) activity. We are currently examining whether this may result from
inverse energy cascades towards large spatial and temporal scales, as suggested
in Arbic et al. (2012). Over most of the global ocean, large-scale ({\textgreater} 12°) lowfrequency
oceanic variability is mostly driven by atmospheric variability. However,
this variance is largely intrinsic in three hotspots (Gulf Stream, Kuroshio,
ACC) where it reaches 50-80\% of the total SSH variance. We argue that
such OGCM-based investigations may provide useful information on the intrinsic
fraction of low-frequency variability in the real ocean, which is mostly
interpreted as directly responding to the atmospheric forcing.},

	abstract = {A global 1/4° ocean/sea ice 50-member ensemble simulation is used to disentangle the low-frequency imprints of the atmospherically forced oceanic variability and of the chaotic intrinsic oceanic variability (IOV) on the large-scale (10° × 10°) ocean heat content (OHC) between 1980 and 2010. The IOV explains most of the interannual-to-decadal large-scale OHC variance over substantial fractions of the global ocean area that increase with depth: 9\%, 22\%, and 31\% in the 0–700 m, 700–2000 m and 2000 m bottom layers, respectively. Such areas concern principally eddy-active regions, mostly found in the Southern Ocean and in western boundary current extensions, and also concern the subtropical gyres at intermediate and deep levels. The oceanic chaos may also induce random multidecadal fluctuations so that large-scale regional OHC trends computed on the 1980–2010 period cannot be unambiguously attributed to the atmospheric forcing in several oceanic basins at various depths. These results are likely to raise detection and attribution issues from real observations.},
