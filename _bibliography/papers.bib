	abstract = {Motivated by the potential of oceanic mesoscale eddies to drive intrinsic low-frequency variability, this paper examines geostrophic turbulence in the frequency–wavenumber domain. Frequency–wavenumber spectra, spectral fluxes, and spectral transfers are computed from an idealized two-layer quasigeostrophic (QG) turbulence model, a realistic high-resolution global ocean general circulation model, and gridded satellite altimeter products. In the idealized QG model, energy in low wavenumbers, arising from nonlinear interactions via the well-known inverse cascade, is associated with energy in low frequencies and vice versa, although not in a simple way. The range of frequencies that are highly energized and engaged in nonlinear transfer is much greater than the range of highly energized and engaged wavenumbers. Low-frequency, low-wavenumber energy is maintained primarily by nonlinearities in the QG model, with forcing and friction playing important but secondary roles. In the high-resolution ocean model, nonlinearities also generally drive kinetic energy to low frequencies as well as to low wavenumbers. Implications for the maintenance of low-frequency oceanic variability are discussed. The cascade of surface kinetic energy to low frequencies that predominates in idealized and realistic models is seen in some regions of the gridded altimeter product, but not in others. Exercises conducted with the general circulation model suggest that the spatial and temporal filtering inherent in the construction of gridded satellite altimeter maps may contribute to the discrepancies between the direction of the frequency cascade in models versus gridded altimeter maps seen in some regions. Of course, another potential reason for the discrepancy is missing physics in the models utilized here.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the origin and features of interannual-to-decadal AMOC variability from several ocean simulations, including a large (50-member) ensemble of global, eddy-permitting (1/4°) ocean/sea-ice hindcasts. After an initial stochastic perturbation, each member is driven by the same realistic atmospheric forcing over 1960-2015. The magnitude, spatio-temporal scales and patterns of both the atmospherically-forced and intrinsic/chaotic interannual AMOC variability are then characterised from the ensemble mean and ensemble spread, respectively. The analysis of the ensemble-mean variability shows that the AMOC fluctuations north of 40°N are largely driven by the atmospheric variability, which forces meridionally-coherent fluctuations reaching decadal time-scales. The amplitude of the intrinsic interannual AMOC variability never exceeds the atmospherically-forced contribution in the Atlantic basin, but it reaches up to 100\% of the latter around 35°S, and 60\% in the northern mid-latitudes. The intrinsic AMOC variability exhibits a large-scale meridional coherence, especially south of 25°N. An EOF analysis over the basin shows two large-scale leading modes explaining together 60\% of the interannual intrinsic variability. The first mode is likely excited by intrinsic oceanic processes at the southern end of the basin and affects latitudes up to 40°N; the second mode is mostly restricted to, and excited within, the northern mid-latitudes. These features of the intrinsic, chaotic variability (intensity, patterns, random phase) are barely sensitive to the atmospheric evolution, and strongly resemble the “pure intrinsic” interannual AMOC variability that emerges in climatological simulations under repeated seasonal-cycle forcing. These results raise questions about the attribution of observed and simulated AMOC signals, and about the possible impact of intrinsic signals on the atmosphere.},

Such areas concern principally eddy-active regions, mostly found in the Southern Ocean and in western boundary current extensions, and also concern the subtropical gyres at intermediate and deep levels. The oceanic chaos may also induce random multidecadal fluctuations so that large-scale regional OHC trends computed on the 1980–2010 period cannot be unambiguously attributed to the atmospheric forcing in several oceanic basins at various depths. These results are likely to raise detection and attribution issues from real observations.},

Deriving sea level trends from finite-length time series in eddy-active regions yields uncertainties induced by this multidecadal IOV, which are of the same order of magnitude as those due to ICV. A white noise model is proposed to approximate the low-frequency tail of the IOV spectra and could be used to update ICV estimates from current climate simulations and projections.},

	abstract = {A seasonally-forced 1/12° global ocean/sea-ice simulation is used to characterize the spatio-temporal inverse cascade of kinetic energy (KE). Nonlinear scale interactions associated with relative vorticity advection are evaluated using cross-spectral analysis in the frequency-wavenumber domain from sea-level anomaly (SLA) timeseries. This analysis is applied within four eddy-active midlatitude regions having large intrinsic variability spread over a wide range of scales. Over these four regions, mesoscale surface KE is shown to spontaneously cascade towards larger spatial scales - between the deformation scale and the Rhines scale - and longer time scales (possibly exceeding 10 years). Other nonlinear processes might have to be invoked to explain the longer timescales of intrinsic variability, which have a substantial surface imprint at midlatitudes.The analysis of a fully-forced 1/12° hindcast shows that low-frequency and synoptic atmospheric forcing barely affects this inverse KE cascade. The inverse cascade is also at work in a 1/4° simulation, albeit with a weaker intensity, consistent with the weaker intrinsic variability found at this coarser resolution.In the midlatitude North Pacific, the spatio-temporal cascade transfers KE from high-frequency Frontal Rossby Waves (FRWs), probably generated by baroclinic instability,towards the lower-frequency westward-propagating mesoscale eddy (WME) field. The WMEs provide local gradients of potential vorticity that support these short Doppler-shifted FRWs. FRWs have periods shorter than 2 months and might be subsampled by altimetric observations, perhaps explaining why the temporal inverse cascade deduced from high-resolution models and mapped altimeter products can be quite different. The nature of the nonlinear interactions between FRWs and WMEs remains unclear but might involve wave turbulence processes.},

The authors investigate the temporal and spatial scales at which this intrinsic oceanic variability has the strongest imprints on sea level anomalies (SLAs) using a ° global OGCM, by comparing a “hindcast” driven by the full range of atmospheric time scales with its counterpart forced by a repeated climatological atmospheric seasonal cycle. Outputs from both simulations are compared within distinct frequency–wavenumber bins. The fully forced hindcast is shown to reproduce the observed distribution and magnitude of low-frequency SLA variability very accurately. The small-scale (L {\textless} 6°) SLA variance is, at all time scales, barely sensitive to atmospheric variability and is almost entirely of intrinsic origin. The high-frequency (mesoscale) part and the low-frequency part of this small-scale variability have almost identical geographical distributions, supporting the hypothesis of a nonlinear temporal inverse cascade spontaneously transferring kinetic energy from high to low frequencies. The large-scale (L {\textgreater} 12°) low-frequency variability is mostly related to the atmospheric variability over most of the global ocean, but it is shown to remain largely intrinsic in three eddy-active regions: the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, and Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Compared to its ¼° predecessor, the authors’ ° OGCM is shown to yield a stronger intrinsic SLA variability, at both mesoscale and low frequencies.},

	abstract = {The low-frequency variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is investigated from 2°, 1/4°, and 1/12° global ocean/seaice simulations, with a specific focus on its internally-generated (i.e. ”intrinsic”) component. A 327-year climatological 1/4° simulation, driven by a repeated seasonal cycle (i.e. a forcing devoid of interannual timescales), is shown to spontaneously generate a significant fraction R of the interannual-to-decadal AMOC variance obtained in a 50-year ”fully-forced” hindcast (with reanalyzed atmospheric forcing including interannual timescales). This intrinsic variance fraction R slightly depends on whether AMOCs are computed in geopotential or density coordinates, and on the period considered in the climatological simulation, but the following features are quite robust when mesoscale eddies are simulated (at both 1/4° and 1/12° resolutions): R barely exceeds 5-10\% in the subpolar gyre, but reaches 30-50\% at 34° S, up to 20-40\% near 25°N and 40-60\% near the Gulf Stream. About 25\% of the meridional heat transport interannual variability is attributed to intrinsic processes at 34°S and near the Gulf Stream. Fourier and wavelet spectra, built from the 327-year 1/4° climatological simulation, further indicate that spectral peaks of intrinsic AMOC variability [i] are found at specific frequencies ranging from interannual to multidecadal, [ii] often extend over the whole meridional scale of gyres, [iii] stochastically change throughout these 327 years, and [iv] sometimes match the spectral peaks found in the fully-forced hindcast in the North Atlantic. Intrinsic AMOC variability is also detected at multidecadal timescales, with a marked meridional coherence between 35°S and 25°N (15-30 year periods), and throughout the whole basin (50-90-year periods).},
